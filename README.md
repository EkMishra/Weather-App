# Weather-App
The Weather App is a simple and user-friendly web application that allows users to check the weather for a specific location with ease. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive weather information retrieval tool

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The app provides an intuitive interface with a city input field and a button to trigger weather information retrieval.
Real-Time Weather Data: It fetches up-to-date weather data from a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and displays it to the user.
Temperature and Conditions: Users can quickly access temperature information in Celsius and weather conditions for any location.
Weather Icon: The app features weather icons to visually represent the current weather conditions.
Error Handling: Robust error handling ensures users are informed if the city is not found or if there's an issue with the API request.
